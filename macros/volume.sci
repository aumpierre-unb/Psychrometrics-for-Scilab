function [v]=volume(Tdry,W,p=101325)
    # Syntax:
    #v 
    # [v]=volume(Tdry,W[,p])
    #
    # volume computes
    #  the specific volume (in cu. m/kg of dry air)
    #  of humid air given
    #  the dry bulb temperature Tdry (in K),
    #  the humidity W (in kg/kg of dry air) and
    #  the total pressure p (in Pa).
    # By default, total pressure is assumed
    #  to be the atmospheric pressure
    #  at sea level (p = 101325).
    # volume is an internal function of
    #  the psychrometrics toolbox for GNU Octave.
    #
    # Examples:
    # # Compute the specific volume given
    # # the dry bulb temperature is 25 Â°C and
    # # the humidity is 7 g/kg of dry air
    # # at 1 atm total pressure.
    #
    # Tdry=25+273.15; # dry bulb temperature in K
    # W=7e-3; # humidity in kg/kg of dry air
    # v=volume(Tdry,W) # specific volume in cu. m/kg of dry air
    #
    # See also: psychro, humidity, satPress, enthalpy, adiabSat.
