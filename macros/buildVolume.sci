function [T,W]=buildVolume(v)
    # Syntax:
    #
    # buildVolume(v)
    #
    # plotVolume generates a two column matrix of
    #  humidity and dry bulb temperature
    #  with given constant specific volume v (in cu. m/kg).
    # By default, constant specific volume curves
    #  are ploted with with green dash-doted thin lines.
    # buildVolume is an internal function of
    #  the psychrometrics toolbox for GNU Octave.
