    # plotWetBulbTemp(Twet)
    #
    # buildWetBulbTemp generates two column matrix of
    #  humidity and dry bulb temperature
    #  with given constant wet bulb temperature Twet (in K).
    # By default, constant specific volume curves
    #  are ploted with with blue solid thin lines.
    # buildWetBulbTemp is an internal function of
    #  the psychrometrics toolbox for GNU Octave.
