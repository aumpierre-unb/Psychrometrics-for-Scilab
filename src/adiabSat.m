function [Tadiab,Wadiab]=adiabSat(h,fig=false)
    # Syntax:
    # [Tadiab,Wadiab]=adiabSat(h[,fig=false])
    #
    # adiabSat computes
    #  the adiabatic saturation temperature Tadiab (in K) and
    #  the adiabatic saturation humidity Wadiab (in Kg/kg of dry air) given
    #  the specific enthalpy h (in J/kg of dry air).
    # If fig = true is given, a schematic psychrometric chart
    #  is plotted as a graphical representation
    #  of the solution.
    # psychro is a main function of
    #  the psychrometrics toolbox for GNU Octave.
    #
    # Examples:
    # # Compute the adiabatic saturation temperature given
    # # the specific enthalpy is 82.4 kJ/kg of dry air and
    # # plot a graphical representation of the
    # # answer in a schematic psychrometric chart.
    #
    # h=82.4e3; # specific enthalpy in J/kg
    # [Tadiab,Wadiab]=adiabSat(h,true) # inputs and outputs in SI units
